Started and stalled work on The Tower implementation
Started work on a more natural way to interact with the calculator
Finished the blackjack component
Adjusted where save files are stored for all outcoming data
Moved Auth Token for distrobution purposes and added a check for the file (Files folder should be missing on first start up)

Added some meme commands such as 'k' that use websites that host images versus storing them locally
